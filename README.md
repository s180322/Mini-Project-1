# Mini-Project-2

Monitoring and control of greenhouse environment play a significant role in greenhouse production and 
management. To monitor the greenhouse environment parameters effectively, it is necessary to design 
a control system. There we can control the activities through PC and send to controller back which is in 
greenhouse environment. The System comprises various modules, including temperature and humidity 
sensors, soil moisture sensors, a light sensor, and an LCD screen. The sensors measure the 
environmental parameters, and the Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the data to control the 
actuators, including fans, heaters, water pumps, and lights. The system provides real-time feedback to 
the user via a LCD display, which displays the environmental data and allows the user to adjust the 
parameters to achieve optimal plant growth. The objective also implies a focus on developing a system 
that is affordable and practical for small-scale and home-based agriculture.
Here in this repo I attached the document related to the project.
